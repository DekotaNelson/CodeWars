A repository filled with codewars coding challenges (kata). Currently push 7 solutions every week. Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar!

# How It's Made:

Tech used: JavaScript

# Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

# Lessons Learned:

I've learned a lot from these coding challenges, but the biggest lesson I've learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve, and these challenges help me to find more ways to improve.
